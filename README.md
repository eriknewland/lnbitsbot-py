# lnbitsbot
telegram bot with lnbits as backend


starter template for running bots based off of lnbits.com or your own install.
To set up your own install fast see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzIPVmCIVAw

Just my quick and dirty outline using lnbits as the backend for a python TG bot
that can:

- create a wallet on lnbits tied to a TG username
- TG users can send links to nonTG users
- link user to lnbits web interface so they can use and add features
- send/receive/tips to other TG users
- gift sats with custom image and message. unclaimed sats should expire and return to sender
- instructions with easy on ramp for users who don't hold sats or bitcoin
- /tx, /log, /lnurl
- Add throttle tx size based on node top capacity
